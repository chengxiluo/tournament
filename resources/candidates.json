They perform this role by taking air into your body and then moving waste gases back out. When you have lung cancer, abnormal (or malignant) cells form a cancerous tumor in your lungs. These cancer cells begin to damage and destroy your lung tissue. Malignant lung tumors may grow very quickly. The American Lung Association (ALA) notes that the uncontrollable growth of a tumor may block your airways, making it difficult to breathe. What's more, sometimes cancerous tumors may spread from one part of your body to another. This happens when a tumor sheds malignant cells, which may then be transported to other parts of your body. The cell may be carried either through lymph fluid that surrounds your lung tissue or through your bloodstream. What Causes Lung Cancer?

However, a sore throat despite its cause should last between 7 to 10 days.

The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the dried fins are exported for use in shark fin soup, the liver oil and cartilage are used medicinally, and the carcass is processed into fishmeal. In 2006, the IUCN assessed this species, including Pacific populations now separated as C. cerdale, as Data Deficient due to a lack of fishery data. In Trinidad, its abundance makes it the most economically important shark. Off northern Brazil, substantial numbers are caught by gillnet fisheries targeting the Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis). In the 1980s, this species constituted roughly 43% of the shark and ray catch, but has since declined to around 17%. This apparent decline is thought to have resulted from increasing fishing effort, the large proportion of juveniles captured, and the shark's low reproductive rate. Consequently, the IUCN has assessed the smalltail shark in Brazil as Vulnerable, and noted the urgent need for conservation measures given that northern Brazil represents the center of the species' range.

The demand for these colourful fishes is high, and breeding is almost impossible to achieve in the home aquarium. The popular species are thus bred on an industrial scale in Southeast Asia. Today all red-tailed black shark s (E. bicolor), all flying foxes (E. kalopterus), and most rainbow shark s (E. frenatum) seen in the aquarium trade are believed to be farm-bred. The main problem for their status is dam ming of rivers between the fishes' usual haunts and the breeding grounds. While otherwise a considerable take of wild Epalzeorhynchus could be sustained, dams will literally stand in the way of successful reproduction, and such isolated Subpopulation subpopulation s are easily extinguished by overfishing. Water pollution is also problematic. Due to these threats, the red-tailed black shark is very rare and was believed to be extinct in the wild, but a tiny wild population is now known, leading to its current IUCN rating as critically endangered. Among the remaining, E. munense is vulnerable, the rainbow shark is considered safe, and the flying fox is data deficient (its status is unclear based on 2009 knowledge).", "topic": "32_2"}

And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt.

Petersen wanted to film it in his native Germany. The studio decided to settle in the States with an American director and Petersen was not long after commissioned by 20th Century Fox to take over the production of Enemy Mine. \"The funny thing about it is that when I was first given the script, I was coming off Gremlins and in a rare point in my career I was like 'hey, let's get this guy,'\" said Dante during a Q&A and screening of the film in 2008.

On his way to school, he hides from the bullies in a bookstore, interrupting the grumpy bookseller, Mr. Coreander. Bastian asks about one of the books he sees, but Mr. Coreander advises against it. His curiosity piqued, Bastian seizes the book, leaving a note promising to return it, and hides in the school's attic to read. The book describes the world of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a force called \"The Nothing\". Fantasia's ruler, the Childlike Empress, has fallen ill, and Atreyu Atreyu is tasked to discover the cure, believing that once the Empress is well, the Nothing will no longer be a threat.

This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic Beaker culture ; again it is unknown whether this was brought about primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation, and again it may be a mixture of both. The Bronze Age sees a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise to prominence of increasingly powerful elites, whose power was enshrined in the control of the flow of precious resources, to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes, and their prowess as hunters and warriors. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the period, numerous examples of extremely fine metalwork begin to be found deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive shift of emphasis away from the sky and back to the earth, as a rising population increasingly put the land under greater pressure.

These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits (e.g.: narcissistic, authoritarian, antisocial, etc.) The experiment, originally planned to span over two weeks, ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards. Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong group dynamic. Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners. Prisoners were made to dress alike, wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns, and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name. Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces.

In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half played guards and the other half prisoners. In six days the experiment derailed. The guards became aggressive, repressive and sadistic. They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. \"From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances\", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the Universiteit van Amsterdam.\"People get carried away,\" said A. Bergsma of Psychologie Magazine. \"Isolation becomes reality. They lose themselves in the experiment. There are no checks and balances. If there is no correction, they will derail one after another.\" All experts agreed that the big reward for the winner increased the chance of accidents. But not all had a negative opinion. A. Lange, a professor of clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the program could produce certain insights not possible to achieve any more in socio-psychological research because the psychological well-being of the participant had been given greater importance. \"The design of the programme is the wet dream of a psychological researcher.

Of particular importance was Irish and Scottish tunes, dance music, balladry and vocal styles, as well as Native American, Spanish, German, French and Mexican music. The instrumentation of early country revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar added later. Country music instrumentation used African elements like a call-and-response format, improvised music and syncopated rhythms. Later still, string instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian music in the early 20th century and the influence of musicians such as Sol Hoopii and Lani McIntyre. The roots of modern country music are generally traced to 1927, when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. Their recordings are considered the foundation for modern country music. There had been popular music prior to 1927 that could be considered country, but, as Ace Collins points out, these recordings had \"only marginal and very inconsistent\" effects on the national music markets, and were only superficially similar to what was then known as hillbilly music.

Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer John T. Mullin and the Ampex corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity (\"HiFi\") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.", "topic": "40_3"}

The development of sound recording had a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The invention of sound recording gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, the Musique concrete style of electronic composition. The invention of multitrack recording enabled pop bands to overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. In the early 20th century, electric technologies such as Magnetic pickups electromagnetic pickup s, amplifiers and loudspeaker s were used to develop new electric instruments such as the electric piano (1929), electric guitar (1931), electro-mechanical organ (1934) and electric bass (1935).

While this software was at best primitive, it nonetheless helped lay the foundation for the future development of the software and synthetic musical production. The early music software was run on large computers at several universities such as Stanford and Penn State. Much of what development came to music software came as a result of the continuous improvement to computers over time. Chain of development is seen clearly in 1978 when nearly 50 music programs came out as a result of MIDI technology, a form of computer communication still used today. MIDI technology provided the key link in hardware for musical software, giving a person a tactile control of an instrument and playing directly into the software in the computer and allowing for maximum control of the production. Fourth generation music software came out in the early 1990s. The largest improvement with this software was the addition of more detailed displays allowing the music software to show more on the screen making the program much easier to use and understand.An important recent development is to automatically transcribe performed music directly to sheet music as developed by ScoreCloud.", "topic": "40_3"}

In the early twentieth century, electronic devices were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as Olivier Messiaen incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While sound recording technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of popular music, new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well.

Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the \"first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans\" Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability. The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk.

Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid, Pennywise, Weezer and Green Day. In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album Dookie, which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous d\u00e9but from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US.

Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of giant armadillo s, giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.", "topic": "56_1"}

Charles Darwin 's early interest in nature led him on a five-year voyage on which established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell 's uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossil s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the transmutation of species and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories.Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.", "topic": "56_2"}

Darwin's work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the mechanism of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were Neo-Lamarckism neo-Lamarckism (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), orthogenesis (\"straight-line\" evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of Mendelism and Hugo De Vries ' mutation theory. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term Darwinism had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin's views, but it became associated with the minority view of August Weismann who went further than Darwin by rejecting inheritance of acquired characters and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called neo-Darwinism. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the modern evolutionary synthesis, which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community.

Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place. This teleonomy is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform.

Within sexual selection Darwin identified a further two mechanisms which are important factors in the evolution of sex differences ( sexual dimorphism ): intrasexual selection (involve competition with those of the same sex over access to mates) and intersexual choice (discriminative choice of mating partners). An overarching evolutionary theory which can provide an explanation for the above mechanisms and strategies adopted by individuals which leads to age disparity in relationships is called Life History theory which also includes Parental Investment Theory. Life History theory posits that individuals have to divide energy and resources between activities (as energy and resources devoted to one task cannot be used for another task) and this is shaped by natural selection. Parental Investment Theory refers to the value that is placed on a potential mate based on reproductive potential and reproductive investment. The theory predicts that preferred mate choices have evolved to focus on reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. This theory predicts both intrasexual selection and intersexual choice due to differences in parental investment; typically there is competition among members of the lower investing sex (generally males) over the parental investment of the higher investing sex (generally females) who will be more selective in their mate choice. However, human males tend to have more parental investment compared to mammal males (although females still tend have more parental investment). Thus, both sexes will have to compete and be selective in mate choices. These two theories explain why natural and sexual selection acts slightly differently on the two sexes so that they display different preferences. For example, different age preferences may be a result of sex differences in mate values assigned to the opposite sex at those ages.", "topic": "56_3"}

Asexual reproduction allows all members of a population to produce offspring and avoids the costs involved in finding mates. However, asexual offspring are clonal, so lack variation. This makes them susceptible to parasites, as the entire clonal population has the same resistance mechanisms. Once a strain of parasite has overcome these mechanisms, it is able to infect any member of the population. Sexual reproduction mixes up resistance genes through crossing over and the random assortment of gametes in meiosis, meaning the members of a sexual population will all have subtly different combinations of resistance genes. This variation in resistance genes means no one parasite strain is able to sweep through the whole population. New Zealand mudsnails are commonly infected with trematode parasites, which are particularly abundant in shallow water, but scarce in deeper water. As predicted, sexual reproduction dominates in shallow water, due to its advantages in parasite resistance.

When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species he acknowledged that the lack of any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against the theory of evolution, but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the future. In the 1860s there were claims of the discovery of pre-Cambrian fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover stromatolites and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with Microfossils microfossils of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the Soviet scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when Martin Glaessner would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by Reginald Sprigg during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the Ediacaran biota the oldest animals known.

Indeed, Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years later, in 1861, and represents a classic transitional form between dinosaur s and bird s.

Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.", "topic": "56_4"}

Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of giant armadillo s, giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.", "topic": "56_4"}

Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of giant armadillo s, giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.", "topic": "56_6"}

In the 1920s, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S.

In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr, advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work Genetics and the Origin of Species helped bridge the gap between genetics and field biology by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species.

It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data. Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard SQL language, using the ANSI standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional RDBMS SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored. Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement. For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer. This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution. SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications. This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application. Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules. In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data. SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally. Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases.

Each of these triangles get Vertex shaders positioned, rotated and scaled on the screen and a special hardware (or in the case of an emulator, the software rasterizer) called rasterizer generates the pixels inside each of these triangles. These triangles are then decomposed into further smaller atomic units called pixels (or in computer graphics terminology, aptly called fragments) that are suitable for displaying on a display screen. The pixels are then drawn on the screen using a certain color; current systems are capable of deciding the color that results in these triangles\u2014for e.g. a texture can be used to 'paint' onto a triangle, which is simply deciding what color to output at each pixel based on a stored picture; or in a more complex case, at each pixel, one can compute if a certain light is being seen or not resulting in very good shadows (using a technique called shadow mapping ).", "topic": "58_2"}

Ocean Networks Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument manufacturer\u2019s standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some conductivity sensors. The quality control testing is split into 3 separate categories. The first category is in real-time and tests the data before the data are parsed into the database. The second category is delayed-mode testing where archived data are subject to testing after a certain period of time. The third category is manual quality control by an Ocean Networks Canada data expert", "topic": "58_4"}

It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data. Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard SQL language, using the ANSI standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional RDBMS SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored. Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement. For example, partitioning by a customer id would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer. This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution. SQLstream Blaze also allows changes to be made to the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications. This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application. Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules. In this way, it provides an effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data. SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally. Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases. SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free. This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.", "topic": "58_5"}

The ACL is very small, smaller than some might think; the average length is 38mm and only 11mm wide. The knee is formed by the connection of the femur (upper leg bone) and the Tibia (lower leg bone) with another two bones been the fibula (small bone next to the tibia) and the patella (the knee cap). Within these two main bones tendons attach the bones to the muscles that give the knee movement, while the ligaments provide the knee with stability. The ACL looks like a mixture of an oval and triangle shape, and is located in a very compact area within the knee. The ACL fibers are in place to give direction for the knee to move, such as a kicking or twisting motion. If an ACL rupture occurs, it immediately forces an increase for not only the anterior tibial translation but also the internal tibial rotation as the femur is pushed back to rotate, this creates trauma to the knee as it is not stabilised. The ACL is there to create rotational stability within the knee to be able to produce different motions.

Most ACL tears are a result of landing or planting in cutting or pivoting sports, with or without contact. Most serious athletes will require an ACL reconstruction if they have a complete tear and want to return to sports, because the ACL is crucial for stabilizing the knee when turning or planting. Reconstruction is most commonly done by autograft, meaning the tissue used for the repair is from the patient\u2019s body. Other times, a cadaver is used for tissue. The two most common sources for tissue are the patellar tendon and the hamstrings tendon. The surgery is arthroscopic, meaning that a tiny camera is inserted through a small surgical cut. The camera sends video to a large monitor so that the surgeon can see any damage to the ligaments. In the event of an autograft, the surgeon will make a larger cut to get the needed tissue. In the event of an allograft, in which material is donated, this is not necessary. The surgeon will make holes in the patient\u2019s bones to run the tissue through, and the tissue serves as the patient\u2019s new ACL. Recovery time ranges between one and two years or longer. A week or so after the occurrence of the injury, the athlete is usually deceived by the fact that he/she is walking normally and not feeling much pain.

The ACL is very small, smaller than some might think; the average length is 38mm and only 11mm wide. The knee is formed by the connection of the femur (upper leg bone) and the Tibia (lower leg bone) with another two bones been the fibula (small bone next to the tibia) and the patella (the knee cap). Within these two main bones tendons attach the bones to the muscles that give the knee movement, while the ligaments provide the knee with stability. The ACL looks like a mixture of an oval and triangle shape, and is located in a very compact area within the knee. The ACL fibers are in place to give direction for the knee to move, such as a kicking or twisting motion. If an ACL rupture occurs, it immediately forces an increase for not only the anterior tibial translation but also the internal tibial rotation as the femur is pushed back to rotate, this creates trauma to the knee as it is not stabilised. The ACL is there to create rotational stability within the knee to be able to produce different motions. Importantly the ACL restraints the anterior tibial translation, providing 85-87% total retraining force", "topic": "59_4"}

Most ACL tears are a result of landing or planting in cutting or pivoting sports, with or without contact. Most serious athletes will require an ACL reconstruction if they have a complete tear and want to return to sports, because the ACL is crucial for stabilizing the knee when turning or planting. Reconstruction is most commonly done by autograft, meaning the tissue used for the repair is from the patient\u2019s body. Other times, a cadaver is used for tissue. The two most common sources for tissue are the patellar tendon and the hamstrings tendon. The surgery is arthroscopic, meaning that a tiny camera is inserted through a small surgical cut. The camera sends video to a large monitor so that the surgeon can see any damage to the ligaments. In the event of an autograft, the surgeon will make a larger cut to get the needed tissue. In the event of an allograft, in which material is donated, this is not necessary. The surgeon will make holes in the patient\u2019s bones to run the tissue through, and the tissue serves as the patient\u2019s new ACL. Recovery time ranges between one and two years or longer. A week or so after the occurrence of the injury, the athlete is usually deceived by the fact that he/she is walking normally and not feeling much pain. This is dangerous as some athletes start resuming some of their activities such as jogging which, with a wrong move or twist, could damage the bones.

In the United States there are about 30 million teenagers and children alone that participate in some form of organized sport. About 3 million avid sports competitors 14 years of age and under experience sports injuries annually, which causes some loss of time of participation in the sport. The leading cause of death involving sports-related injuries, although rare, is brain injuries. When injured the two main systems affected are the nervous and vascular systems. The origins in the body where numbness and tingling occurs upon sports injuries are usually the first signs of the body telling you that the body was impacted. Thus, when an athlete complains of numbness and especially tingling, the key to a diagnosis is to obtain a detailed history of the athlete\u2019s acquired symptom perception, determine the effect the injury had on the body and its processes, and then establish the prime treatment method. In the process to determine what exactly happened in the body and the standing effects most medical professionals choose a method of technological medical devices to acquire a credible solution to the site of injury. Prevention helps reduce potential sport injuries. It is important to establish participation in warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that focus on main muscle groups commonly used in the sport of interest. Also, creating an injury prevention program as a team, which includes education on rehydration, nutrition, monitoring team members \u201cat risk\u201d, monitoring behavior, skills, and techniques.

When considering the substantial amounts of drama teenagers are surrounded by, as well as school itself, one might believe this is the hardest time in life. Adding injury to the stress of everyday life can be very hard for a young person. The students\u2019 parents, coaches, and other care-givers do their best to keep the students safe and enable them to have the best experience high school can offer. To succeed in this endeavor, the child\u2019s safety is a priority. Those student athletes are a specific worry, as they are put at risk more often. One such risk of concern is the high rate of concussions among teens compared to other age groups. There should be specific consideration as to the prevention of concussions, as well as knowledge of how to manage such head injuries. A concussion is known to many as the possible result of a person being hit on the head. What takes place for a concussion to occur involves the human anatomy. Teens Health describes the anatomy head and states \u201cthe brain is made of soft tissue and is cushioned by spinal fluid. It is encased in the hard, protective skull\u201d (Concussions 3). The brain floating inside the spinal fluid is able to move inside the skull. When it is forced in one direction or the other it can actually come into contact with the skull. Teen health continues to explain \u201cthis can lead to bruising of the brain, tearing of blood vessels, and injury to the nerves\u201d (Concussions paragraph 3). Many teens make time to be active in extracurricular activities as well as throughout the community. These activities include a variety of sports which can be risky to the student\u2019s safety. The dangers of playing sports do not necessarily outweigh the benefits of such activities, but they are definitely something to consider. Some sports at specific risk include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football. Football accounts for 45.8% of total reported head injuries for high schools in Missouri (MSHSAA 10). The Sports Concussion Institute states a concussion \u201ccan be caused either by a direct blow to the head, or an indirect blow to the body, causing neurological impairments that may resolve spontaneously\u201d (Concussion Facts 1). The blow to the body causes a series of reactions in the brain which cause a variety of symptoms associated with disruption of the brain. Prevention efforts in high school athletics can start with high quality practice time for the sports in question. For example, a football player who learns the proper way to tackle, spends time in the weight room, and maintains overall good health choices is more likely to avoid situations which put them in harm\u2019s way. Aside from proper learning of the game at hand, the best coaches and parents can to for the students is to educate themselves, as well as the athletes, on knowing the signs of a concussion, as well as being prepared to handle one. The CDC gives a list of possible signs to look for in the players after a jolt to the head or body. These include a dazed appearance, confusion, forgetfulness, lack of confidence in actions, clumsy, slower than normal, loss of consciousness, changes in mood, behavior, or personality, and inability to remember events prior to, or after the hit (Concussion Tool Kit 5). The student may report any of these signs as well as sensitivity to light or sound, double vision, a headache, or any abnormal feelings.If a student displays any of the symptoms described, they should be prevented from participating the rest of the day, and be seen by a health professional. With medical attention, proper care may be given to the student. Their parents should also be informed of the incident so they can also watch for signs of abnormality. Signs and symptoms can last from hours after the injury to months afterward. Recognizing the problem is the first step toward the solution. Coaches should educate themselves about concussions and also provide information for athletes, parents, and other faculty and staff members.The coaches should inquire about their players\u2019 medical history, specifically if they have ever had a concussion before. The Sports Concussion Institute explains after getting one concussion \u201cthey are 1-2 times more likely to receive a second one. If they've had two concussions, then a third is 2-4 times more likely, and if they've had three concussions, then they are 3-9 times more likely to receive their fourth concussion\u201d (Concussion Facts paragraph 7). Once having this information coaches should properly monitor those players who have a history of head injury. Parents and coaches need to express the importance of safety while at play. This also means the guidelines for safety equipment, such as helmets, must be followed. The importance of good sportsmanship should also be stressed to the teams. Those students who have been diagnosed with a concussion are likely to be frustrated, impatient, and angry about the situation. A concussed player could be sitting on the bench for weeks to months depending on when medical professionals clear them to play. It is imperative that they follow the instructions given by those professionals in order to properly recover. In some cases the stress of deep thought can also be difficult, causing greater frustration. The CDC explains, \u201cAfter a concussion, physical and cognitive activities\u2014such as concentrating and learning\u2014should be carefully managed and monitored by a health care professional\u201d (Concussion Tool Kit 7).Ultimately the brain is a vital organ which is also fragile when in an injured state. Once it has been damaged, without proper care, consequences can be severe. The risk for high school aged students is greater than that of older people, so it is important for parents and coaches to take the necessary precautions. Education is the first act of prevention for students as well as coaches, parents, and other faculty and staff. The importance of safety, sportsmanship, and use of equipment should be stressed to high school athletes. With the proper skills in recognition of signs of a head injury, as well as knowledge on the actions to take once a concussion has occurred, the safety of these players can be increased and they can continue to play the games they love.", "topic": "59_8"}

On Counter-Earth Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were not married and did not have children. Shortly after this, Thor was assaulted by an Onslaught-possessed Hulk, who battled Thor to determine which of the two was more powerful. Onslaught switched between the bodies and possessed Thor, who struck the Hulk with lightning. As Thor was about to strike again, he dropped his hammer, as Onslaught was not worthy to carry it. Onslaught switched back to the Hulk, and punched Thor into the atmosphere. Onslaught was assaulted by the Avengers before he could pick up Thor's hammer. Captain America ordered the Human Torch and Iron Man to rescue Thor, telling them they had about sixty seconds for the rescue.

In the battle, Captain America ordered Hawkeye to find Onslaught, and confronted Hawkeye with the fact that Wolverine was hiding in Hawkeye's costume.

Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the Lizard to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators.

The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are closely linked to the blood vessel properties.Carrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the kidneys, regulating the body's defence mechanism, that is, the immune system and facilitating in effective heat and mass transfer across the body are some of the major functions which blood performs in the human body.Blood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition to these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. Serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed.Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma. Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Blood Rheology is the study of blood, especially the properties associated with the deformation and flow of blood. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid. However, often the non-Newtonian effect is very small due to various reasons. Thus, it is important to know about the blood rheology.One of the characteristics of blood that affects the work required to cause the blood to flow through the arteries is the viscosity of blood. The viscosity of blood is in the range of 3 to 6 cP, or 0.003 to 0.006 Ns/m2. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the viscosity of blood is not a constant with respect to the rate of shearing strain. In addition to the rate of shearing strain, the viscosity of blood is also dependent on temperature and on the volume percentage of blood that consists of red blood cells. If blood is made stationary for several seconds then clotting begins in the blood, as a result of which the viscosity of the blood increases. When stationary state is disturbed with increasing shear rate, the clot formation is destroyed and the viscosity decreases. Moreover, the orientation of red blood cells present in the blood also effect the viscosity of blood. Thus, we can say that blood is a shear thinning fluid, i.e., viscosity decreases with increase in shear rate. Beyond a shear rate of about 100s^-1, the viscosity is nearly constant and the blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a viscoelastic material, i.e., viscous and elastic because the effective viscosity of blood not only depends on the shear rate but also on the history of shear rate.It is also important to note that the normal blood flows much more easily compared to rigid particles, for the same particle volume fraction. This is due to the fact that red blood cells can accommodate by deforming in order to pass by one another", "topic": "67_2"}

Up to the first 60 days of life, the yolk sac is the main source of haematopoiesis. The liver is then used as the main hematopoietic organ of the embryo until near birth, where it is then taken over by the bone marrow. Most red blood cells are released into the blood as reticulocytes. Polychromasia occurs when the immature reticulocytes of the bone marrow are released, resulting in a grayish blue color of the cells. This color is seen because of the ribosomes still left on the immature blood cells, which are not found on mature red blood cells. These cells still contain a nucleus as well due to the early release, which is not needed in mature blood cells because their only function is to carry oxygen in the blood. The life span of a typical red blood cell is acknowledged to be approximately 120 days and the time period of a reticulocyte found in the blood to be one day. The percentage of reticulocytes calculated to be in the blood at any given time indicates the rapidity of the red blood cell turnover in a healthy patient. The number of reticulocytes, however, reflects the amount of erythropoiesis that has occurred on any certain day.

Expressed as a percentage, the oxygen saturation is the ratio of the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin, to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin. The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is determined by the type of hemoglobin present in the blood. The amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin at any time is related, in large part, to the partial pressure of oxygen to which the hemoglobin is exposed. In the lung s, at the alveolar\u2013capillary interface, the partial pressure of oxygen is typically high, and therefore the oxygen binds readily to hemoglobin that is present. As the blood circulates to other body tissue in which the partial pressure of oxygen is less, the hemoglobin releases the oxygen into the tissue because the hemoglobin cannot maintain its full bound capacity of oxygen in the presence of lower oxygen partial pressures.", "topic": "67_4"}

The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer", "topic": "67_5"}

The anemia in this condition begins in infancy. Since the anemia results from the premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), it is known as hemolytic anemia. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. When the red cells are broken down, iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released; individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency have an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Movement problems typically become apparent by age 2 in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. The movement problems are caused by impairment of motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. This impairment leads to muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and causes the movement problems typical of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, including involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), tremors, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Affected individuals may also develop seizures. Weakness of other muscles, such as the heart (a condition known as cardiomyopathy) and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can also occur in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Diaphragm weakness can cause breathing problems and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Individuals with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are at increased risk of developing infections because they have poorly functioning white blood cells. These immune system cells normally recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. The most common infections in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency are bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. People with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency often do not survive past childhood due to respiratory failure. In a few rare cases, affected individuals without severe nerve damage or muscle weakness have lived into adulthood. The deficiency is most commonly caused by mutations in TPI1, although mutations in other isoforms have been identified. A common marker for TPI deficiency is the increased accumulation of DHAP in erythrocyte extracts; this is because the defective enzyme no longer has the ability to catalyze the isomerization to GAP. The point mutation does not affect the catalysis rate, but rather, affects the assembly of the enzyme into a homodimer", "topic": "67_6"}

The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause megaloblastic anemia was not new. What was new was the idea that drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities.

Humans are made up of trillions of cells that form the structure of our bodies and carry out specialized jobs like taking nutrients from food and turning them into energy. Red blood cells, which contain hemoglobin deliver oxygen to all parts of the body. All cells have a nucleus at their center which is kind of like a brain or command post of the cell.

The nucleus contains DNA otherwise known as Deoxyribonucleic acid, a long spiral shaped molecule that stores the genes that determine hair color, eye color, whether or not the person is right or left handed, and many more traits. DNA, along with other genes and the information they contain, is passed down from parents to their children during reproduction. Each cell has many DNA molecules, but because cells are very small and DNA molecules are long, the DNA is packaged very tightly in each cell. These packages of DNA are calls chromosomes, and each cell has 46 of them each package is arranged into 23 pairs with one of each pair coming from the mother and on from the father.

House finds it surprising that Jeff admitted he is taking illegal enhancement drugs. He agreed to blood doping, which is common among cyclists, to better one's athletic performance. Because red blood cells carry oxygen between the lungs and the muscles, a higher number of red blood cells can increase an athlete\u2019s endurance. While trying to figure out what cause of Jeff\u2019s respiratory distress, they find an embolus in his chest. While Dr. Chase works to remove the air bubble, Jeff begins to feel numbness in his legs, but is told that it might be due to the sedation. While his manager talks to the press, Jeff loses feeling in his legs. Dr. Cameron informs House that Jeff\u2019s red blood count is continually dropping, revealing that his body is no longer able to produce red blood cells on its own. House becomes convinced that Jeff might have lied about a specific drug that could be the cause of all of his symptoms, Erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced in the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Adding more blood cells increases the oxygen level in the blood, thus presumably causing all of Jeff's symptoms as he fails to produce red blood cells on his own. Which is explanation for him also having anemia, caused by a chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), probably resulting from his use of blood doping. After responding to a Prednisone treatment, Jeff began losing more red blood cells to the point of requiring a transfusion. House scans Jeff's neck and a Thymoma is discovered; an extremely rare tumor on the thymus, confirming that he wasn\u2019t taking EPO, but he did have Chronic Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia. Due to the diagnosis he can legally blood dope, or get a Thymectomy which could only bring him into a temporary remission, and then after he would have to be on medical steroids", "topic": "67_9"}

It is only available in higher amounts due to the ease of digestion of high glycemic index foods. In individuals with normal carbohydrate metabolism, insulin levels rise concordantly to drive glucose into the body's tissues and maintain blood glucose levels in the normal range. Insulin stimulates the uptake of valine, leucine, and isoleucine into skeletal muscle, but not uptake of tryptophan.

However, since many doctors are unfamiliar with the condition, it often goes untreated or is treated inappropriately; DSPD is often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia or as a psychiatric condition. DSPD can be treated or helped in some cases by careful daily sleep practices, light therapy, dark therapy, and medications such as melatonin and modafinil (Provigil); the former is a natural neurohormone partly responsible for the human body clock. At its most severe and inflexible, DSPD is a disability. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established, as the patient's body has a strong tendency to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late times.

They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as Catawba chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses. Significant peoples of several tribes, including Muscogee Creek and Wampanoag, wore turkey feather cloaks. The turkey clan is one of the three Lenape clans.

Late Preclassic (300 BC\u2013AD 100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the Mexican turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) to the ancient Maya world. The Mexican subspecies, M. g. gallopavo, was domesticated, either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in Mesoamerica, giving rise to the domestic turkey. The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from England, unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts.

When Freeman returned to Hopkins in 1969, the diet was being used on only a few patients. Freeman revived the diet for wider use on children for whom multiple medicines were ineffective. According to Guy McKhann, the founding director of the Hopkins Department of Neurology, Freeman effected the \"resurrection\" of the diet \"virtually all by himself, against great skepticism and opposition.\" In 1994, Freeman was contacted by Jim Abrahams, a movie director whose son, Charlie, was suffering from epilepsy that had not responded to anticonvulsants. Charlie's epilepsy was cured on the ketogenic diet, and the story of his cure was the inspiration for the film...First Do No Harm. Abrahams founded The Charlie Foundation To Help Cure Pediatric Epilepsy, which is now known as The Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies.", "topic": "78_2"}

At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual\u2019s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small was the head of the sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology. Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program\u2019s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program\u2019s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E.

It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as Comte, Karl Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can\u2019t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002", "topic": "79_1"}

An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method was sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as philosophy.This perspective, termed positivism, was first developed by theorist Auguste Comte. Positivism was founded on the theory that the only true, factual knowledge is scientific knowledge. Comte had very vigorous guidelines for a theory to be considered positivism. He thought that this authentic knowledge can only be derived from positive confirmation of theories through strict continuously tested methods, that are not only scientifically but also quantitatively based. \u00c9mile Durkheim was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research, seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or \" social fact s\". Durkheim proved that concepts that had been attributed to the individual were actually socially determined. These occurrences are things such as suicide, crime, moral outrage, a person\u2019s personality, time, space, and God. He brought to light that society had influence on all aspects of a person, far more than had been previously believed. For him, sociology could be described as the \"science of institution s, their genesis and their functioning\". Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social solidarity.

Sociology was to be the \"queen science\" in Comte's schema; all basic physical sciences had to arrive first, leading to the most fundamentally difficult science of human society itself.

However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim's concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, \"the determination of function is\u2026necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, \"When... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills\" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists do not necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought. Thus functionalism is either undefinable or it can be defined by the teleological arguments which functionalist theorists normatively produced before Merton.", "topic": "79_7"}

This new theory is said to have taken place in reaction to structural functionalism and in many ways represents antithesis. The conflict theory attempts to bring together structural functionalism and Marxism. According to Dahrendorf, functionalism is beneficial while trying to understand consensus while the conflict theory is used to understand conflict and coercion. In order to understand structural functionalism, we study three bodies of work: Davis and Moore, Parsons, and Merton. Dahrendorf states that capitalism has undergone major changes since Marx initially developed his theory on class conflict. This new system of capitalism, which he identifies as postcapitalism, is characterised by diverse class structure and a fluid system of power relations. Thus, it involves a much more complex system of inequality than Marx originally outlined. Dahrendorf contends that postcapitalist society has institutionalised class conflict into state and economic spheres. For example, class conflict has been habituated through unions, collective bargaining, the court system, and legislative debate. In effect, the severe class strife typical of Marx's time is not longer relevant. Dahrendorf's theory often took the opposite view of functionalists.", "topic": "79_9"}

Authors set up alternative ideas that need to be introduced and explored. Even the staunchest proponents of the Greed vs. Grievance theory believe that other outside forces (beyond the greed and/or grievance) can have an effect on conflict, which makes the critiques all the more vital in understanding the theory itself. One of the most prevalent authors in rebutting greed vs. grievance is author David Keen, in his book Complex Emergencies. David Keen, a professor at the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics, has several innovative and new ideas regarding the ideas of war. His work is considered by many to be one of the leading arguments against greed vs. grievance theory. His ideas look into the specifics of complex emergencies, which is a term officially defined by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) as:\"A multifaceted humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires a multi-sectoral, international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing UN country program. Such emergencies have, in particular, a devastating effect on children and women and call for a complex range of responses.\"Keen discusses how a conflict can never be simply a greed scenario. His definition of a \"complex emergency\" demonstrates this broader term and all of its various implications. In his book, Keen goes into several different conflict scenarios, such as 'war', 'famine', and 'information', and then sets up an argument against the idea of greed. He believes that although a conflict, whether it be the 'War on Terror' or the conflict in Sierra Leone, may be centered around some concept of greed or grievance, this can never solely explain a conflict. Although seemingly obvious, Keen looks to demonstrate that, \"the aims in a war are complex\". He does not believe that greed and grievance can be examined separately, but rather that they are partner terms that must be implemented in a complementary way. For example, when Keen discusses the conflict in Sudan, he says, \" the grievances of northern pastoralists were useful for a government trying to get its hands on oil in areas that famine and militia attacks helped to depopulate; meanwhile, the 'greed' of the Arab militias themselves (for labour, cattle and land) was itself intimately linked to their grievances\". He makes it clear that it is necessary to first spend ample time defining the type of conflict at hand because the differences between genocide and a civil war are substantial, so it is necessary to diagnose the incentives and solutions for the conflict with a mix of multiple theories. Keen specifically critiques Paul Collier, a leading expert in greed vs. grievance theory, by claiming that Collier became too comfortable with \"numbers\", and needed to rely more on the actual opinions of people involved in conflicts. He spoke of Collier's work and said, \"This is where econometrics tips over into arrogance and starts closing down the possibility of a genuine understanding of conflicts or, by extension, of a political settlement that addresses underlying grievances\". He doesn't believe that it can be dismissed so easily. He was documented saying, \"It also annoys me that a lot of the 'scientific air' of the Collier work is quite bogus as the selection of proxies is so arbitrary\", which demonstrated a distinct attack on Collier's work, which emphasizes quantitative data", "topic": "79_9"}
